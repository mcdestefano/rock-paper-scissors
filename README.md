# rock-paper-scissors
An interactive game of classic rock paper scissors.

This project is my first JavaScript project written from scratch. It is intended for me to get some early practice with JavaScript and is quite simple, and a more complex user interface will be added in a later project.

Note: The game does not currently account for players entering values other than rock, paper, or scissors. If one such value is entered, the result of that game will be a tie.
